Amplify and deamplify scale towards zero +/- ten percent.
I typically hotkey map these to Ctrl+> to increase and Ctrl+< to decrease.
You can already do this with the scale tool in the Graph Editor or the Pull Push tool in the Animation Toolbar.
This feels faster and more comfortable to me -- it is a little more "no-look" so you can keep your eyes on the viewport and relax your stylus hand.
