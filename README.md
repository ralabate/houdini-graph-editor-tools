## [de]amplify_keyframes.py 

Scales the selected curves by ten percent.

I hotkey map these to **Ctrl+>** to increase and **Ctrl+<** to decrease.
You can already do this with the box handle or, more recently, the Pull Push tool in the Animation Toolbar.

This is just a little faster and more comfortable; it is a little more "no-look" so you can keep your eyes on the animation and relax your stylus hand.

## copy_and_offset.py

Duplicates a curve onto its children and offsets the keyframes by five frames.

I hotkey mapped this to **Ctrl+Shift+O**.

Useful for setting up mechanical chains, tails, etc.
