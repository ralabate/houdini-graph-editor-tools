Amplify and deamplify scale towards zero +/- ten percent.

I typically hotkey map these to **Ctrl+>** to increase and **Ctrl+<** to decrease.
You can already do this with the box handle or, more recently, the Pull Push tool in the Animation Toolbar.

This is just a little faster and more comfortable; it is a little more "no-look" so you can keep your eyes on the viewport and relax your stylus hand.
